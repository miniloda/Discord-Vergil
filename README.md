# Discord-Like Project(React-Tailwind)
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and TailWind CSS. This project was a clone of Fireship's [Ultimate TailWind CSS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfaSUYaSgRo) with a little bit of modification as a way to understand Tailwind CSS.

To run the project on your computer, clone the repo and run `npm install` on the cli on the correct directory. Afterwards, run `npm start` to run the development server.
